# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: node_modules NOT Included

The `node_modules` folders are intentionally NOT uploaded to GitHub.

This is standard industry practice because:
- node_modules is very large
- It slows down Git
- Anyone can regenerate it using `npm install`

After cloning the project, you MUST install dependencies manually.
